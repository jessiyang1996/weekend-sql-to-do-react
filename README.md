## Description

Ever needed a simple and easy to understand app to keep track of things you need to accomplish? This app does just that! It's a simple app that allows users to add tasks to a database and print it out onto the DOM. Users can also mark a task as completed or not and delete the task when it is no longer needed.

I used JavaScript, React, Axios, PG, etc. in order to build this app. We used routes to build the router, axios to do the route requests, .map to loop over the array of objects and print it onto the page, react to make our app code more precise and less repetitive, useState to declare our variables, useEffect to do our initial page load, and Material UI to add some design to the site.
